    <h1>Array Handling, Memory Allocation, and Moving Pointers</h1>
    
    <h2>Arrays</h2>
    <p>An array is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. Here's an example of how to declare and initialize an array in Java:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            int[] numbers = new int[5];
            numbers[0] = 1;
            numbers[1] = 2;
            numbers[2] = 3;
            numbers[3] = 4;
            numbers[4] = 5;
        </code>
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Memory Allocation</h2>
    <p>Memory allocation refers to the process of reserving a block of memory for storing data. In Java, memory allocation for arrays is done using the 'new' keyword. Here's an example:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            int[] numbers = new int[5];
        </code>
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Moving Pointers</h2>
    <p>In programming, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Moving pointers involves changing the value of the pointer to point to a different memory location. Here's an example in C++:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            int* ptr = nullptr;
            int number = 10;
            ptr = &number;
        </code>
    </pre>
